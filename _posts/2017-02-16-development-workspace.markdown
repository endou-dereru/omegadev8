What am i using for development?

I have little notebook with very low resources (integrated videocard, 1gb ram etc). But it doesn't meant i have to use old technologies, so that's my list:
1. OS: Windows 10 + Lubuntu LTS
1. Utils (yes, that's important): 
    - Git
    - Bash (on windows it's included in git package with MSYS-like MINGW environment)
    - SSH
    - CMake
    - Ruby
    - VC++
    - Clang (+ llvm, lldb and etc)
    - Python3 (Anaconda python distribution)
    - Nodejs LTS
1. IDEs: 
    - Visual Studio
    - Intellij Idea (community)
    - Intellij Pycharm (community edition as well)
    - Qt Creator
1. Programs:
    - Gimp image editor
	- Blender for 3d manipulation
	- Audacity for audio editing
	- SimpleScreenRecorder
